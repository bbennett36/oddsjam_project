OddsJam DataScience assignment

The goal of the assignment is to come up with a working strategy on how to improve the number and/or the quality of +EV bets.
There are different strategies you can use to decide what is a “better” +EV bet. It’s up to the candidate to decide on a reasonable metric to optimize for.

+EV Bets are basically bets that are mathematically favorable for the bettors. It is based on the concept of determining what are the true odds for an event and identifying the sportsbooks that diverge the most from the true odds which are favorable to the bettor.


You can use all the files in the dataset or a subset of them at your discretion. 
The betting tools files are related to the odds files based on the timestamp. All the +EV in the betting tools files are identified by the type: “EDGE” property. The other kind of bets can be ignored for this specific assignment.

Assignment
Come up with a working prototype in Python or Jupyter Notebook in how you would approach improving the +EV bets identified using the dataset of odds and compare it against the dataset of +EV (Edges) betting tools.

You should be able to select some bets that you would consider +EV and be able to compare with the ones generated by OddsJam contained in the Betting Tools dataset.
